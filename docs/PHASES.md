# Phases and Steps

Execute in order. After every step: real tests → 100% → commit + push `main`.

## Status: v0.6.7 (Library Move chunked copy — field gate open)

Package version is **0.6.7**. Cross-drive Library Move uses chunked copy with cancel; duplicate paths transfer once; missing Uncategorized job paths can be healed from the download tree. **Do not claim the live 4.5 GB youtube tree is fixed** until `temp/library_move_*.log` from that tree shows `OK #2+`. See [LIBRARY.md](LIBRARY.md) and [AUDIT_FULL_v0.6.3_FIELD.md](AUDIT_FULL_v0.6.3_FIELD.md).
